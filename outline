### Introduction

We all have error handling in our code and we all hate it.  We need it, though.  So I've been on this quest to better understand handling error's place in our applications.  And it comes down to this main point: that error handling is a main abstraction in systems and most of us are missing it.

introduction and hook that error handling is a missing abstraction in most systems, and it must be started early.  Error handling is an inevitable part of every application.  Systems becomes much worse when treated as something to be added only when needed.  The developer's user experience with the system fundamentally changes when error handling is looked at as an early, and mature part of a system.

This talk is not about the operational setup for fault tolerant systems.

### Part I: The Problem

Problems:

- complexity: readability, and reusability
- too many ways to exit, flow control
- errors are invisible, no real idea of where or when more will occur
Code problems introduced by error handling:
- testing

Errors are difficult in and of themselves: like gotos they are invisible and jump us out of our normal execution -- invisible and many possible exit points.

"plague"

- no discernable abstractions made; but common for happy path -- almost immediately and often too soon, though abstractions around error handling are not common to discuss

### Part II: The Principles

Async JS:

State applies to more than data, but to the health of the program.

Also, having an abstraction that executes the happy path, but can also divert down the error path when it happens makes this possible.

Erlang:

- Fail Fast
- Chocolate Shell and Supervisors

Go

Errors as Values: promises simpler, easier to read code. This also helps developers reason about flow control and make abstractions when errors happen.  Reasoning about making an abstraction around an if or while loop is more common than try/catches or begin/rescues.  Though this doesn't gaurentee clean abstractions -- we can still write bad code with simple if's and loops.

Pre and PostConditions: supplied by the compiler, but this gives a natural introduction to handling error from the beginning, and makes it much more likely that error handling becomes a part of discussion before more convention is solidified.

This helps reusability of our components since they all fail the same way -- with values.

Errors are communication mechanisms: This also goes into the theme that error handling is for communication.

RxJS

State handlers: on success, on error; injected

This shows that state applies to more than your data.  State can be applied to the execution of your program in terms of being run with errors or not.  And a separate object takes over execution of your program when a new state is entered.

Benefits: separate and easy to understand.  

Principle: Scope error handler by use case

The complexity of the error handler is proporitional to the complexity of the code it is handling.  The more code a single handler encapsulates the more complex the handler will be.  The simplest handlers would be on a per function scope.  Use the same constraints you would with other abstractions for simplicity in the handler.  This also shows that handlers are scoped by use case.

Look at it like a strategy pattern.  Depending on the state, a different stategy is used.

Principle: Error and Success are states your application runs in

State patterns are well-known and makes the program easy to compartmentalize in terms of failure during execution.  Instead of having the state be combined with the happy path, now there is an explicit place to look and modify logic.

And even though every application doesn't make this clear, this happens in every application.  Every application will have either a success state or failure state during its run.

To me, this is an enlightening way to view error handling -- the execution of your program changes state when something unexpected happens.  So now it becomes a philisophical question about what should we do when bad things happen?

Some catch then return some default data, or use the null object pattern.  Some fail and retry.  Some just swallow the error and continue.

Erlang

Fail Fast: error handling isn't just about exceptions, but about control mechanisms that return data based on the state of execution.

Let it Crash: like Feather's talk of the chocolate shell and creamy center.  cleaner code, simpler flow of execution and system's response to failure

Principle: Immutable state; uniform way of failing and NO NILS OR NULL DATA

Mentally this is freeing -- there is no fear of how your app will behave during failure -- it just jumps to the error state flow.  Custom responses to errors are easy and extensible, too, allowing for fast and reliable turn around when adjusting the application for specific errors.

This is like immutablity in success state of the application.  We like immutability for our data, and we get the same benefits when we use it for our success state as well.

These are easier to accomplish when an application is viewed as an ordered list of transformations.  Since the error handling will be specific to the use case and why the objects were drawn together.

Principle: Shared nothing components

Shared nothing components: availability problems in one component will cause availability problems in another component that depends upon it.

Reduce or at least control the errors that occur by design:

There are also semaphores and circuit breakers and timeouts to accomplish similar outcomes that erlang provides from shared-nothing -- these patterns help cleanup locked threads and memory in an efficient manner.  See Hystrix.

Also strive to structure code with simple input output functions that don't depend on more objects -- if one function fails, then fail fast and the handler will know what to do based on the use case the function is consumed in.  Like Uncle Bob's clean architecture with entities and use cases.  The error handlers are in the use cases part.

### Part III: The Patterns

review the high level combinations discussed:
1. They all have design patterns to encapsulate and control the error.  In all, we are in a position to control error programatically and with abstractions.

- strategy to observer pattern, like async js shows
- decorator pattern based on use case, like erlang shows
- errors as values as go shows

2. As part of convention, you must decide how your system reacts when an error occurs.

Data consistency and protection -- Fail fast, or at least be conscious of the scope and shared knowledge of default data or null objects.

3.  Decide on the best information and data structure to return after failure.  Errors are letters penned to someone of our choosing.

at a high level these all have to do with developing consistent APIs, or interfaces, and encapsulating the way a program responds when something goes wrong.  It brings it back to classic programming.

Then go over the code as a possible solution.

### Conclusion

- good abstractions are low-level and separate from business logic
- error is about retaining business value and customer respect
- we now have ideas to centralize discussion around
